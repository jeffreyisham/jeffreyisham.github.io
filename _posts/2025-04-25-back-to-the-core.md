<p>I can tell you this, getting layed off sucks. But I'm back to it now. And I'm right at the core. <a href="https://www.sitecore.com" target="_blank">Sitecore</a> that is. I'm happy to report I just finished my first week at my new job as Demo Delivery Manager with Sitecore. It's been about six months since I was layed off but I'm fortunate my network is deep and I recieved a good severance package. I knew it would just be a matter of time before I got back to work if I could stand waiting it  out. The job market right now is rough. But I'm super excited about my new gig. It will require a nice blend of my experience and I think I'll have the opportunity to learn a lot.</p>
