<p>Back with another semi-irregular post! Usually these posts coincide with moving on to something new. This one is kind of that. I was restructured out of my most recent job, which is a bummer becasue I liked it and learned a lot.</p>
<p>So now I'm putting together my next move and thinking about my experience over the last 20 years. I’ve done a whole bunch of stuff. I’ve built global implementation teams, led QA transformation efforts, worked on pretty much every content management system out there, and a ton more. But mainly I have enabled my various teams for efficient, successful software delivery across numerous technology platforms and I'd like to keep doing that (if you're out there looking for someone talented to join your team, hit me up).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've had time to lean into my hobbies and am happy to report I'm on the verge of releasing some new artwork! More to come on that in the new year...</p>
