<p>Here it is folks, after a 10 year long run with <a href="http://olson.com" target="_blank">Olson</a>, I've made the decision to move on. I'm on to a new role with <a href="http://horizontalintegration.com" target="_blank">Horizontal Integration</a>, firmly solidifying my place in middle management. Looking forward to the challenge. Don't worry Internet, I'm still in you.</p>
