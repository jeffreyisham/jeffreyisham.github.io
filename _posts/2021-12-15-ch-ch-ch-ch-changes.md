<p>Long time, no post. All 10 of you, along with the spammers that hang on my every word will be pleased to know that I've taken a new job!</p>
<p>I'm super proud of my accomplishments at Horizontal Digital. Under my tenure as Practice Lead, the global frontend discipline transitioned into key contributors on nearly every active project, across all agency supported platforms. The team headcount grew by 400% with high retention and growth opportunities at all levels.</p>
<p>All that said, it was time for a change. I'm off on a new adventure, stepping out of the agency/consulting world and going full corporate. I'm now at U.S. Bank leading several teams in the continued growth and development of their internal design system, Shield. And I'm a Vice President. Boom. Still doing awesome shit.</p>
