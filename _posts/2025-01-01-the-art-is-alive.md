<p>I haven't been super busy making art, but I have been busy getting my art out into the real world! Have a look: <a href="https://www.coolerthanthefuture.com">coolerthanthefuture.com</a></p>
<p><em>Collected Variations</em> is an exploration of process. The initial work for this collection started in 2019 with a series of ink drawings using Spirograph gears to guide composition. Subsequent layers of hand drawn work pushed the tension between the organic and mechanical aspects of the work. The images were further developed digitally and the resulting collection begged to be brought back into the analog world. The final objects are things the viewer can spend time on or with—a book, a picture, and a postcard.</p>
<p>I love making art. I do it to sustain a daily desire to make cool stuﬀ, solve problems of my own devising, and put some weird ideas out into the world.</p>
<p>I really hope you enjoy it!</p>
