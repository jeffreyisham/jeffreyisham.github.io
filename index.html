        <p>As a Creative Technologist, I enjoy the challenge of working to align the realities of technical implementation with creative experience design. My job description has a lot of bullet points on it, but let's just say I get shit done. Currently, I live in the Minneapolis area and lead the Shield Interfaces team at U.S. Bank in the continued build out of their internal design system.</p>
        <p>I'd best describe myself as a platform agnostic, frontend specialist who isn't too shabby on the backend. I am an experienced problem solver, focused on strategy and user experience. I'm an expert with CSS and Javascript, specializing in standards-based, accessible, client-side interactions. I've led teams and executed numerous digital campaigns and enterprise solutions for a wide variety of brands, including: Target, General Mills, Nike Bauer, wet n wild, Kidrobot, United Health Group, the Belize Tourism Board, Pantone, New York Life, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of MN.</p>
        <p>My name is Jeffrey and I enjoy biking, cats, and long walks on the beach.</p>
