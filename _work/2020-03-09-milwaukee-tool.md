<p>Milwaukee Tool engaged Horizontal to help bring the launch of a new product line to life online. Scroll driven, frame-by-frame animated sequences led users through key value propositions and functionality. In collaboration with the creative and UX teams, we produced a proof-of-concpet that led to the MX Fuel launch and additional implementations across key landing pages on the site.</p>
