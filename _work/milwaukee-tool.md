  title: Milwaukee Tool - MX Fuel Launch | Jeffrey Isham
tags: [award, Horizontal, project, work]
---

<p>Milwaukee Tool engaged Horizontal to help bring the launch of a new product line to life online. Scroll driven, frame-by-frame animated sequences led users through key value propositions and functionality. In collaboration with Creative and UX team members, we produced a proof-of-concept that led to the MX Fuel launch and additional implementations across key landing pages on the site.</p>
